    <h1>Basic informations about CSS Styleheets</h1><hr>
    <p><span>Cascading style sheets (CSS)</span>  - are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.</p>
    <p><span>CSS</span> - is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.</p>
    <p><span>CSS</span> - Cascade Style sheets are used for giving a better look to the web pages.</p>
    <p><span>CSS</span> - are using selectors to edit singular or multiply elements of HTML code</p>
    <p><span>CSS</span> - simply is used to edit styles defaulted by the web browsers.</p>
    <p><span>CSS</span> - files which are recommended to use, are linked to the HTML code by link tag which should be placed in the head of the HTML code</p>
    <p><span>CSS</span> - as was marked above is using selectors as id or class as same as the tag names etc.</p>    
    <p><span>CSS</span> - can be commented by using /* Here you can enter comment of CSS code */ comment marks</p>
    <p><span>CSS</span> - can be implemented on the three ways:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Inline</span> - is the strongest ftom the styles what means that is very hard to overwrite it, but is not recommended to use becouse of the placw it takes in code.</li>
        <li><span>In Head</span> - is not recommended becouse of the place of code it takes in HTML code.</li>
        <li><span>From file</span> - is thee best to use becouse it does not confuse the people who are reviewing the code.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><span>Id & class selectors</span> - used in CSS are marked as '#(id-name)' for Id's and '.(class-name)' for classes. There are also different possibility of merging them if we would like or need to. </name></p>
